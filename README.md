# 3dPrintingFiles
A collection of stl files that I made for 3d printing.

# phone clip.stl

* Used to create a basic stand for my phone to rest on next to my bed.
* Ideally, 2-3 of these would be printed, and then connected with cardboard to form a stand that a phone can be placed in.

# drawer-puller

* adds a little handle to my drawer to make it easier to pull open, this one kind of didn't work very well
